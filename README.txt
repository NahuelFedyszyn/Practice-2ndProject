This is my second project.
This will not be a single day one like the forst one, and I will try to visit the code almost everyday to improve it a little bit day by day.

The idea here is to build a website with information about me, the things I like, the things I don't like, a contact form, and a way to download my resume.

That's it. Let's go

17/02/2021

Added images, hover effects on images, illumination on divs.
Added app.js
Added function to scroll: Now it hides header when scrolling sown, and shows it up when scrolling up
Added contact form (Only html and css)
Added "Things I like" section (Only html and css)
Added footer icons: Icons are linked to my linkedIn profile, GitHub profile and Instagram profile

Next session:
I'll be working in the header 
Building one last section with more information about me (maybe linked to another page with emphasis on my carrer and life objectives)
